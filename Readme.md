# Emacs-html

Some packages to help when writing HTML with Emacs.

## html-script.el
A package that helps when you are editing an (X)HTML file that contains blocks of code in another language, such as PHP, CSS, JavaScript, or Visual Basic. With one keystroke, you can narrow the buffer to a code block, and switch to the appropriate major-mode for that language, and then switch back again to editing the whole file in the original mode. It works with both Emacs' built-in html-mode and with nxml-mode.

## html-chooser-mode.el
Provides a set of templates for beginning an XHTML or HTML document, and helps to decide what mode to use when opening either an existing or a new file. By default, it uses nxml-mode for XHTML and html-mode for HTML.
